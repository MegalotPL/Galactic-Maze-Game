My application is a console-based text adventure game that requires the user to navigate through various scenarios using textual commands. The game is designed to stimulate the user’s imagination and creativity, as the graphic de- sign is limited to console text output. The game follows the journey of a space traveler with an important mission to reach a specific destination. However, during the journey, the protagonist encounters a malfunctioning spacecraft and is forced to enter it. The ship is rife with danger and darkness, and the player’s only hope is to find a way to escape.
